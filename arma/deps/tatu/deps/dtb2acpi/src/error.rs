//! Error types for `dtb2acpi`.
//!
//! Two trust boundaries → two error types, both surfaced through
//! [`crate::AcpiBuffer::populate`]:
//!
//! - [`DtbError`] — the DTB itself is wrong, missing, or inconsistent.
//!   Wrapped inside [`EmitError::Dtb`] when returned.
//! - [`EmitError`] — the caller-supplied buffer is too short, or a
//!   per-table emitter's defense-in-depth re-walk of the tree surfaced
//!   a [`DtbError`].
//!
//! `EmitError::Dtb` exists for defense-in-depth: per-table emitters
//! re-walk the borrowed tree, and a tree that [`crate::count::run`]
//! accepted cannot in practice produce a re-walk failure — but the
//! type system can't prove that, so the variant has to exist.
//!
//! The principle that shapes [`DtbError`]: **partial binding = error,
//! absent binding = OK (if optional)**. If a binding's trigger is
//! present in the DTB, every required piece of that binding must
//! validate; missing required pieces surface as a `DtbError`.
