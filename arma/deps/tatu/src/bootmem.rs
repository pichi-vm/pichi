//! x86_64 boot CPU tables, baked into the tatu binary at build time.
//!
//! The boot vCPU enters long mode, so dillo must load `cr3` and `gdtr`
//! *before* tatu's first instruction. Those structures therefore can't
//! be built at runtime — they ship as two fixed sections:
//!
//! - `.tatu.pgt`: 4-level identity map of the first 4 GiB using 2 MiB
//!   pages (PML4 + PDPT + 4× PD = 6 pages = 24 KiB).
//! - `.tatu.gdt`: one page holding a 3-entry GDT (null, 64-bit code at
//!   selector `0x08`, 64-bit data at `0x10`).
//!
//! Both are throwaway — Linux reloads `CR3`/`LGDT` in `head_64.S`.
//!
//! The page-table entries are self-referential: each inter-table pointer
//! embeds the table's own GPA. A `const fn` cannot read a static's
//! link-time address (`&STATIC` is a relocation, not a const value), so
//! the base is [`crate::sections::PGT_BASE`] — itself derived at const-eval
//! time as the prefix sum of the sections that precede `.tatu.pgt`, which
//! is exactly where the linker packs it. arma never reads this constant:
//! it discovers the section's GPA from tatu's ELF section table and
//! cross-checks it.

// `link_section` overrides trip the unsafe-code lint; this whole module
// is the documented x86 placement contract (linker/x86_64.ld), not a
// soundness hazard — same pattern as the reserved input sections.
