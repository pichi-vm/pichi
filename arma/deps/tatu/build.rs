//! Bare-metal link configuration for tatu.
//!
//! tatu builds for `*-unknown-none` with a fixed-address linker script;
//! the host build (`cargo test`, which exercises the `#[cfg(not(target_os
//! = "none"))]` stub) is an ordinary executable and needs none of this.
//!
//! These were once `[target.*-unknown-none] rustflags` in
//! `.cargo/config.toml`, but config is discovered relative to the
//! invocation's cwd (not the crate), and a relative `-T` linker path is
//! resolved by the linker against rustc's cwd — which is the *workspace
//! root* for a workspace member. Emitting the flags here instead keeps
//! them attached to the crate: the linker-script path is absolute (via
//! `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`) so it resolves no matter where cargo runs, and
//! `rerun-if-changed` actually tracks edits to the script. This is what
//! lets tatu be a plain workspace member rather than its own workspace.
