# pichi

The docker/podman-style front-end for the [pichi-vm](https://github.com/pichi-vm)
ecosystem: it manages VM images as OCI artifacts and boots them.

`pichi` owns image management — importing, pulling, pushing, and inspecting
artifacts in a local content-addressed cache — and delegates the actual VM
launch to the [`dillo`](https://github.com/pichi-vm/dillo) VMM. `pichi run`
derives the guest's device set from the cached artifact, then `exec()`s dillo.

## The artifact model

A pichi artifact is an OCI image composed of:

- **scute layers** — the read-only block-device layers of a
  [carapace](https://github.com/pichi-vm/carapace) (the guest root filesystem),
- an optional **PMI** layer — the measured boot payload (kernel + initramfs)
  produced by [`arma`](https://github.com/pichi-vm/arma), described by the
  [`pmi`](https://github.com/pichi-vm/pmi) wire-format spec,
- an optional detached **base DTB** layer, and
- a **config** blob — the launch contract (CPU / memory / interface
  requirements).

An artifact is *bootable* exactly when it carries a PMI. A carapace with no PMI
is still a valid image — a base others derive from.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pichi import` | Import a raw image (+ optional PMI / DTB / config) into the cache |
| `pichi images` | List cached artifacts |
| `pichi inspect` | Inspect a cached manifest |
| `pichi tag` / `rmi` | Manage tags (refcount-aware blob GC) |
| `pichi pull` / `push` | Move artifacts to and from an OCI registry |
| `pichi run` | Boot a cached artifact (prepares the environment, execs dillo) |
| `pichi build` | Build an artifact from a `pichi.build/` project inside a VM |
| `pichi system` | System-level inspection and maintenance |

Run `pichi <command> --help` for details.
