//! Caller-supplied OEM identity stamped into every emitted table.

//! ACPI lets the platform firmware author pick vendor-identifying
//! strings that appear in every SDT header plus the RSDP. They show up
//! in guest-OS diagnostics (e.g. Linux `dmesg | grep ACPI`).
//!
//! Every call to [`crate::AcpiBuffer::populate`] requires an explicit
//! [`OemIdentity`] — this crate ships no defaults, because a generic
//! library can't sensibly pick a vendor string on the caller's behalf.

/// a compile error. Strings shorter than the field width should be
/// zero-padded to the right.
///
/// Not `#[non_exhaustive]`: the ACPI SDT header is a closed layout, so
/// no new identity fields will appear. Callers may construct via
