//! 16-byte-aligned ACPI table region.
//!
//! ACPI 6.5 §5.2.5.1 requires the RSDP to be 16-byte aligned. The
//! emitted layout places the RSDP at offset 0 of the output buffer,
//! so the buffer itself must be 16-byte aligned. [`AcpiBuffer`]
//! enforces that at the type level via `#[repr(align(16))]` — no
//! runtime check, no caller-side discipline.
//!
//! `N` is the buffer size in bytes. Callers either pick a
//! compile-time-known reservation size (typical for guest firmware
//! with a fixed ACPI region) or over-allocate to a `MAX` that covers
//! every realistic layout.

/// metadata, no padding, `size_of` == `N`.
///
/// Construct with [`Default::default`] or the `const` [`Self::new`];
/// fill with [`Self::populate`], which returns the live image length.
/// After a successful `populate` the buffer's first byte is the RSDP,
/// and `base_gpa` (the value the caller passed) is what they publish to
/// the OS — the two coincide when the buffer's host/guest address equals
/// `base_gpa`. Because it is a newtype, `&buffer as *const _ ==
/// buffer.as_ref().as_ptr()` (the bytes are at struct offset 0).
///
/// **Alignment is the caller's responsibility.** ACPI 6.5 §5.2.5.1
/// requires the RSDP (buffer offset 0) to be 16-byte aligned; a
/// transparent `[u8; N]` has alignment 1, so the buffer must be placed
/// where its base is 16-aligned. PMI consumers get this for free — the
/// ACPI region is a page-aligned section (e.g. tatu wraps it in a 4 KiB
/// `Paged` slot).
///
/// **Stack size**: `Default::default()` materializes `[0; N]` directly
/// on the caller's stack before any move. For a tight boot stack, place
/// the buffer in a `static` slot via [`Self::new`] (a `const fn`).
