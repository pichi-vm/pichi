//! The host-side network backend contract for virtio-net.
//!
//! [`VirtioNet`](crate::VirtioNet) is transport- and host-agnostic: it moves
//! L2 Ethernet frames between the guest's RX/TX virtqueues and a
//! [`NetBackend`]. The backend is what actually delivers those frames to the
//! outside world — a Linux TAP device, a macvtap endpoint, or (on every host) a
//! [`NullBackend`] sink that gives the guest a link-up NIC with no peer.
//!
//! Backends only ever see raw Ethernet frames — never the 12-byte
//! `virtio_net_hdr`, which the frontend strips on TX and prepends on RX.
